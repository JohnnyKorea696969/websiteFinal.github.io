            <div class="minorBox7">What is Computer Science? (CS)</div>
            <div class="minorBox8">
                According to the Michigan Institute of Technology, "..Computer science focuses on the development and testing of software and software systems." It involves working with mathematical models, data analysis and security, algorithms, and computational theory. <br><br>
                I am currently studying at the Universidad Francisco de Vitoria in Madrid. During my first semester, I have been assigned to eight different classes as part of a hybrid 'bilingual' program. 75% of all content is taught in Spanish, and around ~25% is taught in English. Out of the eight, I will be addressing the six which are most connected with my career path of choice and discussing my thoughts on each one.

            <div class="minorBox7">Administration and Development of Operating Systems</div>
            <div class="minorBox8">
                The class focuses on introducing students to the concepts of software emulation and virtualization, while also addressing the basics of network intercommunication between clients. We are taught rudimentary terminal commands relating to IP and Mac addresses and learn of how they are used by I.T staff in virtual workplace environments. Thus far, we have learnt about Data protocol management and intercompatibility between computer systems. Virtually all content within this class is taught in Spanish, although occasionally, instructions of certain software are addressed in English to prevent the language barrier from interrupting our learning process.<br><br>
                Overall, I believe it to be one of the classes I enjoy the most as it ties thoroughly into subjects such as SQL injections, Data Packet interceptions (Snooping), and other processes which I consider to be very important to the Cybersecurity employment market and which I wish to learn more about.

            <div class="minorBox7">Introduction to Cybersecurity</div>
            <div class="minorBox8">

                This class touches upon the modern state of Cybersecurity and how it came to be. It extensively discusses issues in modern models of Cybersecurity software and how a Computer Scientist or Software engineer must be capable of dealing with different types of Cyberattacks. Despite this only being our first year of superior studies, we have already covered various manners through which one can prevent DNS Spoofing, Cryptojacking, or Credential stuffing. Our classes, while not very dynamic, always touch upon subjects that I find to be very interesting.<br><br>
                The class, while officially in Spanish, de facto often finds most of its content being translated to English by students as the sources of the software which we utilize are often of North-American origin. Overall I enjoy the class as it encompasses a lot of the subjects which got me interested in Computer Science to begin with and I feel it adequately addresses many of the issues relating to modern CyberSecurity and the various methods through which they can be approached.

            <div class="minorBox7">Discrete Mathematics</div>
            <div class="minorBox8">

                A class with an emphasis on the practical applications of graph theory, adjacency matrices, finite sets and linear algebra.  Taught entirely in Spanish, the subject always focuses on how the mathematics taught are used in a Computer Science enviroment. <br><br>
                I find the class to be interesting as I have always had an innate fascination for mathematics, and graph theory alongside statistics were actually the fields of mathematics which I was most interested in during my studies in High School. While the subjects taught may be somewhat hard to grasp conceptually at times, the subject itself remains thoroughly compelling to me. A very competently taught class for a complex field of study.Discrete mathematics plays a crucial role in computer science and provides the theoretical underpinnings for various algorithms and data structures.

            <div class="minorBox7">Applied Mathematics for Engineering I</div>
            <div class="minorBox8">

                Arguably the hardest class of the semester, but a crucial one for anyone who wishes to become an engineer nonetheless. Applied mathematics for engineering is one of the foundations of our course as it highlights the axioms upon which many of the algorithms we are currently studying, [Ie; PageRank, HITS, Divide&Conquer] were designed and built. Despite its challenging nature, I find the class to be interesting as it forces me to leave my comfort zone and learn more about a subject which I was somewhat inexperienced with prior to joining this university course.<br><br>
                Overall, I feel as though it may be the most important subject taught this semester as many of the skills and abilities which we learn during classes will be essential for the practical applications of the knowledge we acquire in University later on, in the workplace enviroment.
