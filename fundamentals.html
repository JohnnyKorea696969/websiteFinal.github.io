            <div class="majorBox1919">'Fundamentals of Computer Engineering' is one of the various subjects taught during the first semester at the Universidad Francisco de Vitoria. The subject is taught by various teachers and is available in both Spanish and English to the various students partaking in their first year. The syllabus, while extensive, is taught in such a manner that Students can learn of both the theoretical and practical applications of the content which they are learning. <br><br>
            
            This static webpage is one such example of this dynamic system, as it was built with the purpose of serving as a Midterm project for the class as an introduction to the three programming languages most-commonly used in front-end webpages [HTML, CSS, JavaScript] prior to engaging with the a class taught in the second semester, known as 'Object-Oriented Programming', where students will be learning of Databases, utilizing XAMPP localhosts and learning how to make use of back-end languages (such as PHP) to make their websites more dynamic.  <br><br>

            Fundamentals of Software Engineering can be considered a subject of moderate difficulty: mostly theory-based, and with a syllabus which requires the memorisation of various key concepts as opposed to critical thinking, as is the case with subjects such as Mathematics or dynamic Programming, the subject will require a robust and consistent interest in the content it contains for the students who wish to attain the highest marks available.
